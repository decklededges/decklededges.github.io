This website exists to serve as an (opinionated) repository of game design patterns and information for Tabletop Role-playing Games, often abbreviated as TTRPGs.

Many such repositories already exist in the form of blogs. Unfortunately, blogs are not a positive format for organising information in a useful way.  

This is also not a wiki - mostly for reasons of layout and access. You *can* interact with this site - by accessing the github link and making your own pull requests. As an opinionated site, your changes may be accepted or rejected. If you're seeing this page early on in the life of this site, I probably want your opinion.

I want to be very transparent about the history of the site and updates that will regularly be made to its pages in lieu of a blog - which is why the github repository is publicly accessible.

For information on the opinions this site has, please see the 'Premises' link above.
