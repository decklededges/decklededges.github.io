# Attribution and Quotation

This website draws on an immense wealth of existing game design theory and discussion. Unfortunately, much of this is lost to various blogs and message boards instead of any one central place.  

If you're reading this and think "hey, that sounds like something I wrote" please contact me and we'll see what we can do to get you credit.

## Existing Attributions

A significant amount of outline on this site has been influenced by my own reading of [D Vincent Baker's blog](http://lumpley.com/index.php).
